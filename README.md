## Introduction

<!-- DropQ -->

TML is a Python package for dropout-based dataset pruning in binary classification tasks. Itâ€™s designed for PyTorch Lightning users who need to perform high-confidence predictions, dataset pruning, and robust model training. TML accepts custom architectures, enabling flexible and reliable predictions in real-world scenarios.


## Installation

<!-- the environment was created with this:
`conda env export --from-history > environment.yaml`
Note: consider removing the prefix line in the `environment.yaml` -->

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EhsanKA/tml.git
cd tml
conda env create --file environment.yaml
conda activate tml
pip install .
```


<!-- ## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/EhsanKA/tml.git

``` -->


<!-- For contribution please install in dev mode and use pre-commit
```bash
yes | conda create --name pika python=3.10
conda activate pika
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
``` -->

<!-- ## Usage -->

<!-- ### Commandline


Nested keys can be parsed as below as long as all keys are present in the config
```bash
python run_pipeline.py --config tml/configs/config.yaml
``` -->

<!-- ### Python -->
<!-- 
Please check [notebooks](notebooks/comparing_outputs_tf_torch.ipynb) for checking the torch implementation.
